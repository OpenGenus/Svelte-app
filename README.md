# Svelte-app

Svelte is an open-source frontend framework created by Rich Harris and is currently maintained and developed by a large group of developers. The main advantage is that it shifts a lot of the work that happens at runtime to compile-time, resulting in more efficient code. This, in turn, minimizes the need for runtime libraries, making the final application lightweight. 

# Requirements

To run the application, you'll need the following:

- **NodeJS & NPM**

`Windows and macOS`: Download the Node JS installer from the official website (https://nodejs.org) and follow the installation instructions. It is recommended to download the LTS version for stability.

`Linux`: Use the package manager of your distribution to install Node JS.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs npm
```

# Running the Application

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub by opening your command line or terminal and running the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenGenus/Svelte-app
```

2. Change the current directory to the cloned repository:

```bash
cd Svelte-app
```

3. Launch the application by running the command:

```bash
npm i && npm run dev
```

Please note that these instructions assume you have Git installed on your system. If you don't have Git, you can also manually download the repository from GitHub by visiting the repository URL ([github.com/OpenGenus/Svelte-app](https://github.com/OpenGenus/Svelte-app)) and clicking on the "Code" button, then selecting "Download ZIP". After extracting the ZIP file, navigate to the extracted directory using the command line or terminal and proceed with step 3 to run the application.
